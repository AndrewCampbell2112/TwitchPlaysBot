# TwitchPlaysBot
This is a bot that can be used for a twitch plays channel. The bot reads the chat and when it sees a certain command, 
it either sends a message back or does a keypress, emulating a key on a keyboard being pressed.

IMPORTANT:
Make sure you have python installed as well as the node.js api.
