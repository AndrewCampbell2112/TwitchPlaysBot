# TwitchPlaysBot
This is a bot that can be used for a twitch plays channel. The bot reads the chat and when it sees a certain command, 
it either sends a message back or does a keypress, emulating a key on a keyboard being pressed.

IMPORTANT:
Make sure you have python installed as well as the node.js api.
In the TwitchBot.js file; 
- On line 7; put in your bot's name
- On line 8; put in your oauth password (see below)
- On line 11; put the twitch channel(s) you want the bot to run on

ABOUT THIS BOT:
This bot makes use of twitch's free twitch developer's code which can be found at: https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc. 
For this bot to work, you will require an oauth password generated by twitch which can be created by loging in with 
your twitch account here: https://twitchapps.com/tmi/. 

The "Controls.txt" file can be changed depending on what controls you want your twitch chat to see are available to 
them (it has no effect except being sent to the chat by the bot when the command "!commands" is sent in chat).

The "keyPress.py" file is used to allow for keypresses to be done locally and prints a line of what button was pressed
each time in the "textFile.txt" file.

The "if statements" in the "TwitchBot.js" file can be changed to any button on the keyboard but also need to be 
mirrored in the "keyPress('')" function in the "if statement".
